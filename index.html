          <h2>Bio</h2>

          <p>My name is Sophia Montie (she/her) and I am studying Creative Technologies and Design at the University of Colorado Boulder.
            I come from a town in northern Virginia called McLean where I have been living for the past ten years. Some of my interests are 
            swimming, crocheting, and spending time with friends and family. My goal for this class is to be able to make a website that 
            reflects my interests as well as a portfolio.
