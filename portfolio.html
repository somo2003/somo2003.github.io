                <p>In ATLS 1100: Design Foundations, we studied elements of design and how to implement them into real world problems. Some of the 
                    projects we worked through were designing a fail page for a website, an advertisement for a new brand or place, and a magazine cover 
                    inspired by an adjective. To the right, I have displayed the magazine cover I created for the word, "Spooky". This work was created using
                    Adobe Photoshop.

                <p>In ATLS 2100: Image, we are currently studying photography and the use of Adobe Photoshop. For the first project of the semester, we were instructed
                    to create a photo book of images on a topic we were passionate about. The topic I chose was crocheting, which is a hobby I love to do in my free
                    time. In this picture, is an example of one of the tops I made with a digital stylized background I created.
